# HR Data Exploratory Data Analysis

I performed Exploratory Data Analysis on HR Data.

These are the insights I found from the data:

- From the scatterplot, there is NO significant relationship between Salary and Employee Satisfaction.

- Correlation of Employee Satisfaction with other variables shows that none of the variables has significant impact on employee satisfaction.

- Special Projects Count has just slight influence on salary of employee.

- Production Technician I is the most populated job with 44.05% people doing it.

- Most of the employees were recruited from Indeed.

- Means salary of employees is $69,020
